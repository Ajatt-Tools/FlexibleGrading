List of options:

* `color_buttons` - Enable button coloring according to the list below.
* `colors` - Map each button's label to an HTML color code or name.
For the list of colors, see [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp).
* `flexible_grading` - Grade cards from their front side without having to reveal the answer.
* `pass_fail` - Enable Pass/Fail mode. `Hard` and `Easy` buttons will be hidden.

Disabled buttons are visible but unusable and un-clickable.

By default, answer buttons aren't shown.
