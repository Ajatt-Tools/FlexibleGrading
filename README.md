Ajatt-Tools Flexible Grading for Anki 2.1 significantly overhauls the reviewing process.
It puts keyboard first and allows you to go through your reps by pressing `hjkl`
while having your hands lay naturally on the home row of the keyboard.
It goes further by removing review buttons and letting you grade your cards from the question side.

## Features

* Vim bindings. Put mouse away when doing your reviews.
    * `h` - Fail
    * `j` - Hard
    * `k` - Good
    * `l` - Easy
    * `u` - Undo
    * `i` - Edit
* Flexible grading.
Grade cards from their front side.
Save yourself a few extra keypresses if you know that you know the answer.
* Color coding for answers. Default colors:
    * `Fail` - Red
    * `Hard` - Orange
    * `Good` - Green
    * `Easy` - Blue
* Remove answer buttons. Possible options:
    * `Hide`. Completely remove answer buttons (enabled by default).
    * `Disable`. Disabled buttons are unusable and un-clickable.
* Toggleable Pass-Fail mode.
Removes `Hard` and `Easy` buttons and keybindings.
Make decisions easier by having to choose
whether you know a card or not instead of how well you know it.
Avoid being stuck in
[Ease Hell](https://youtu.be/1XaJjbCSXT0?t=665)
by using this feature in combination with the recommended
[Options Groups settings](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/setting-up-anki.html#options-groups).
* Last grade is shown on the toolbar.
It is possible to click on it and bring up the Anki browser with the card selected.
* Consistent key mappings for the `1234` keys.
`2`, `3` and `4` always grade `Hard`, `Good` and `Easy` respectively.
Only relevant for the V1 scheduler.
V2 scheduler does this out of the box.
