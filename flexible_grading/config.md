List of options:

* `color_buttons` - Enable button coloring according to the list below.
* `colors` - Map each button's label to an HTML color code or name.
For the list of colors, see [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp).
* `flexible_grading` - Grade cards from their front side without having to reveal the answer.
* `pass_fail` - Enable Pass/Fail mode. `Hard` and `Easy` buttons will be hidden.
* `prevent_clicks` - Make answer buttons at the bottom disabled.
Disabled buttons are visible but unusable and un-clickable.
* `remove_buttons` - Remove answer buttons. Only the corresponding intervals are visible.
* `show_last_review` - Print the result of the last review on the toolbar.
* `press_answer_key_to_flip_card` - Answer keys ('h', 'j', 'k', 'l' by default) will be used
  to reveal the back side, similarly to the Space bar.

By default, answer buttons aren't shown.
Press vim keys on the keyboard to grade cards.

* `h` - Again
* `j` - Hard
* `k` - Good
* `l` - Easy
